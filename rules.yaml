rules:
- title: Dimension name not in snake case
  code: D101
  rationale: Dimension names should match the conventional format, which is snake
    case—words in lowercase, separated by underscores. For example, **order_id** instead
    of **orderId** or **OrderID**.
  select:
  - dimension
  - dimension_group
  regex: ^[_a-z0-9]+$
  negative: false
  type: PatternMatchRule
- title: Measure name not in snake case
  code: M103
  rationale: Measure names should match the conventional format, which is snake case—words
    in lowercase, separated by underscores. For example, **count_orders** instead
    of **OrderCount**.
  select:
  - measure
  regex: ^[_a-z0-9]+$
  negative: false
  type: PatternMatchRule
- title: View name not in snake case
  code: V100
  rationale: View names should match the conventional format, which is snake case—words
    in lowercase, separated by underscores. For example, **all_orders** instead of
    **allOrders** or **AllOrders**.
  select:
  - view
  regex: ^\+?[_a-z0-9]+$
  negative: false
  type: PatternMatchRule
- title: Name of count measure doesn't start with 'count_'
  code: M100
  rationale: You should explicitly state the aggregation type in the dimension name
    because it makes it easier for other developers and Explore users to understand
    how the measure is calculated.
  select:
  - measure
  filter:
  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: type
    value: count
  - operator: OR
    type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: type
    value: count_distinct
  regex: ^count_
  negative: false
  type: PatternMatchRule
- title: Name of sum measure doesn't start with 'total_' or 'sum_'
  code: M101
  rationale: You should explicitly state the aggregation type in the dimension name
    because it makes it easier for other developers and Explore users to understand
    how the measure is calculated.
  select:
  - measure
  filter:
  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: type
    value: sum
  - operator: OR
    type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: type
    value: sum_distinct
  regex: ^(?:total|sum)_
  negative: false
  type: PatternMatchRule
- title: Name of average measure doesn't start with 'avg_' or 'average_'
  code: M102
  rationale: You should explicitly state the aggregation type in the dimension name
    because it makes it easier for other developers and Explore users to understand
    how the measure is calculated.
  select:
  - measure
  filter:
  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: type
    value: average
  - operator: OR
    type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: type
    value: average_distinct
  regex: ^(?:avg|average)_
  negative: false
  type: PatternMatchRule
- title: Yesno dimension doesn't start with 'is_' or 'has_'
  code: D100
  rationale: Wording the name of a **yesno** dimension as a question makes it clear
    to the user what a yes or no value represents.
  select:
  - dimension
  filter:
  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: type
    value: yesno
  regex: ^(?:is|has)_
  negative: false
  type: PatternMatchRule
- title: Measure references table column directly
  code: M110
  rationale: Measures should not directly reference table columns, but should instead
    reference dimensions that reference table columns. This way, the dimension can
    be a layer of abstraction and single source of truth for **all** measures that
    reference it.
  select:
  - measure.sql
  regex: \$\{TABLE\}
  negative: true
  type: PatternMatchRule
- title: Dimension group name ends with redundant word
  code: D200
  rationale: "When Looker creates the underlying dimensions, Looker appends the name\
    \ of the timeframe to the dimension group name. For example, for a dimension group\
    \ called **order_date**, Looker will create dimensions with redundant names: order_date_date,\
    \ order_date_month, order_date_year, etc. \n\nInstead, use **order** as the dimension\
    \ group name, which becomes **order_date**, **order_month**, etc."
  select:
  - dimension_group
  regex: _(?:at|date|time)$
  negative: true
  type: PatternMatchRule
- title: Explore doesn't declare fields
  code: E100
  rationale: 'When fields are explicitly defined, LookML developers can easily identify
    the fields included in the Explore without having to reference the view file or
    loading the Explore page.


    This is especially helpful when the Explore includes multiple joins and a subset
    of fields from each joined model.'
  select:
  - explore
  criteria:
  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: fields
  negative: false
  type: ParameterRule
- title: Explore missing label
  code: E111
  rationale: 'Explores should define a label to provide a user-friendly name for the
    Explore in menus. Looker generates title-cased names for Explores based on the
    name in LookML, but these names aren''t always useful for users. For example,
    an auto-generated Explore name **Prod Sessions L3d** (generated from explore:
    prod_sessions_l3d) is not as succinct or informational as **Web Sessions**.'
  select:
  - explore
  criteria:
  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: label
  negative: false
  type: ParameterRule
- title: Visible dimension missing description
  code: D301
  rationale: Dimensions that are visible in the Explore page should have a description
    so users understand how and why to use them, along with any caveats.
  select:
  - dimension
  - dimension_group
  filter:
  - operator: NOT

  negative: false
  type: ParameterRule
- title: View must define at least one primary key dimension
  code: V110
  rationale: Views must define a primary key so that any Explores that reference them
    can take advantage of symmetric aggregates and join them properly to views. This
    rule only applies to views that have defined a **sql_table_name** or **derived_table**
    parameter.
  select:
  - view
  filter:
  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: derived_table
  - operator: OR

    parameter_name: primary_key
    value: 'yes'
  criteria_on: dimension
  negative: false
  type: ParameterRule
- title: View missing label
  code: V111
  rationale: 'Views should define a label to provide a user-friendly name for the
    view in Explores. Looker generates title-cased names for views based on the view
    name in LookML, but these names aren''t always useful for users in Explores. For

    prod_sessions_l3d) is not as succinct or informational as **Web Sessions**.'
  select:
  - view
  criteria:
  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: label
  negative: false
  type: ParameterRule
- title: Primary key dimension not hidden
  code: D302
  rationale: Primary keys are not typically used directly in Explores because users
    are more interested in aggregates like measures, which reduce the grain beyond
    the grain of the primary key. Thus, these dimensions should be hidden.
  select:
  - dimension
  filter:
  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: primary_key
    value: 'yes'
  criteria:
  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: hidden
    value: 'yes'
  negative: false
  type: ParameterRule
- title: Dimension not in alphabetical order
  code: D106
  rationale: 'Sort dimensions alphabetically to make it easier to find a dimension
    while scrolling through a view file.


    A dimension or dimension group violates this rule if it is not alphabetically
    sorted with respect to the previous dimension or dimension group.


    Primary keys are excluded from the set of dimensions used to determine alphabetical
    order.'
  select:
  - dimension
  - dimension_group
  filter:
  - operator: NOT
    type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: primary_key
  alphabetical: true
  is_first: false
  use_key: true
  type: OrderRule
- title: Measure not in alphabetical order
  code: M106
  rationale: 'Sort measures alphabetically to make it easier to find a measure while
    scrolling through a view file.


    A measure violates this rule if it is not alphabetically sorted with respect to
    the previous measure.'
  select:
  - measure
  alphabetical: true
  is_first: false
  use_key: true
  type: OrderRule
- title: Primary key dimension not the first dimension in this view
  code: D107
  rationale: The primary key should be listed first in a view so developers quickly
    understand the grain of the view and what a single record represents.
  select:
  - dimension
  filter:
  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: primary_key
    value: 'yes'
  alphabetical: false
  is_first: true
  use_key: true
  type: OrderRule
- title: Dimension label includes redundant "Yes/No"
  code: D303
  rationale: For **yesno** dimensions, Looker adds "Yes/No" to the end of the dimension's
    label by default, so there's no need to include it in the label.
  select:
  - dimension.label
  regex: (?i)Yes/No
  negative: true
  type: PatternMatchRule
- title: View uses the same table as another view
  code: V112
  rationale: Views should not have the same **sql_table_name** because two views with
    the same table name are effectively the same view. Instead, consolidate these
    views into a single view.
  select:
  - view
  type: DuplicateViewRule
- title: Name of persistent derived table view doesn't start with 'pdt_'
  code: V113
  rationale: Views that define persistent derived tables should be prefixed to make
    it easy to identify views based on PDTs.
  select:
  - view
  filter:
  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: datagroup_trigger
  - operator: OR
    type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: sql_trigger_value

    type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: materialized_view
    value: 'yes'
  filter_on: derived_table
  regex: ^pdt_
  negative: false
  type: PatternMatchRule
- title: Include uses a wildcard
  code: I100
  rationale: Including all views using a wildcard (e.g. *.view) slows down LookML
    compilation and validation. Instead, explicitly include the specific views that
    you need.
  select:
  - include
  regex: \*\.view
  negative: true
  type: PatternMatchRule
- title: Join doesn't define its relationship explicitly
  code: J100
  rationale: 'If the **relationship** parameter for a join is omitted, Looker will
    use a default relationship of **many_to_one**. However, it''s better to define
    the relationship explicitly so that developers scanning the code can quickly understand
    the join.


    Explicitly defining the relationship can also help prevent errors caused by mistyping
    or using the wrong columns in the join condition. '

  - join

  - type: ParameterFilter
    parameter_name: relationship
  negative: false
  type: ParameterRule
